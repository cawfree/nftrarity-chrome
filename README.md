💸 🧸 📈 A Chrome plugin to display the rarity of an NFT inline on OpenSea 🌊

## Okay you dirty apes!
This is a super basic [**Chrome**](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/) extension to help you **discover** NFT rarity on [**OpenSea**](https://opensea.io/), using metrics served by [**nftrarity.net**](https://nftrarity.net/) 💖

## 🚀 Usage

 - Download and unzip [`extension.zip`](./extension.zip)
 - In Chrome, go to `Extensions` and click on `Load unpacked`
 - Navigate to directory of your unzipped `extension.zip` (you should find the folder which contains the file `manifest.json`)
 - Load the extension!

Next, head over to an asset list on [**OpenSea**](https://opensea.io/), i.e. [**Arabian Camels**](https://opensea.io/assets/arabian-camels) and open up your  **Developer Tools**. Whenever you `mouseover` an asset, it's rarity will be printed in the console. 💪

By the way, if you _don't_ trust the compiled zip for whatever reason, you can build this package yourself:

```sh
yarn && yarn build
```
